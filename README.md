# AspireIQ Demo Component

I spent the 4h completing this component, the functionality required is all there. There are a couple things I would still like to have added for polish, listed under Other work/TODOs.

## Design/Functionality suggestions
- Add ability to remove previously entered + valid email on backspace
- When added email is valid, add blue pill box around email, similar to the invalid email pill
- Add ability to arrow key through list of suggested emails
- * I added that once an email is selected, it will no longer show as an option in the autocomplete

## Other work/TODOs
- Text, eg. placeholder 'Email Suggestions' to come from external i18n object
- Add inset box shadow at bottom of suggested email list
- Fix height being adjusted by a few px when error pill shows
